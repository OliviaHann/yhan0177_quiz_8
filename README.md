# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My inspiration based on the painting 'Ntange II (Grass)' by Emily Kame Kngwarreye. The planet Pandora from the Avatar film shows a fantastical scene illuminated by bioluminescent plants and creatures. They help to create a strong visual impact, evoking a sense of wonder and fantasy, similar to the captivating visuals in the painting. In terms of colour, the vibrant blues, purples and greens of the picture contrast strongly with the reds, pinks and yellows of 'Ntange II (Grass)'. The glowing effects of the organisms and plants on the image provide a way to make the scene more mysterious.
